# Arduino Wakeup Lights
This repository contains the state of my Arduino wakeup light.  
Its purpose is to wake me up in the morning as addition to my normal alarm.  
The setup is based on [this tutorial and code](https://www.instructables.com/Wakeup-Lights/) by RalphCrutzen.

## Hardware 
* Arduino Mega
* RTC DS 1302
* WS2812E LED Strip
* Arduino LCD/Keypad Shield

The tutorial above is more or less what I did to get my setup up and running. 

## Codebase
The codebase can be found in this repostiory. 
Please notice that it is still under construction and could contain some hidden features (called bugs).
